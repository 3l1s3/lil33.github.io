					<h2>Explorations through a Scattered Mind</h2>
					<p>I'm typically not one for trivia or quotes; however, I absolutely love Mary Shelley. She was brilliant. The following words of hers have always especially moved me...</p>
					<blockquote>"...nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose&#8209;&#8209;a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye."<br><br>&#8209;&#8209;Frankenstein (The Modern Prometheus)

        <p>I tend to focus on minutiae. It took me quite a while to decide how I wanted to format my <a href="index.html" target="_blank">journal</a>.</p>

            <p>I still haven't been able to fix my <a href="peopleCard/peopleCard.html" target="_blank">People Card </a>as I would like.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>However, I have a whole bunch of <a href="peopleCard/imgLinks.html" target="_blank">cool images</a> which I formatted to what I thought would be the optimal size (150px x 150px) for the People Card.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Failing to get them to work within an array, I combined them all to make a little <a href="peopleCard/movieLink.html" target="_blank">movie </a>with the intention of playing it within the picture frame.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>I also have this cool <a href="peopleCard/floatingImage.html" target="_blank">floating image </a>which I failed to incorporate.</p>

            <p>So, for my <a href="project.html" target="_blank">project </a>, I wanted to make a user-interface for an Arduino project.<br><br>
            I sketched my own images and wanted to make them responsive to both the Arduino project and an image map.<br><br>
            The <a href="project.html" target="_blank">project </a> remains a work in progress.<br><br>
            I found some cool snippets and swapped-out some code...</p>

          <section>
            <p>They could <a href="bouncingImage.html" target="_blank">bounce</a> off of the frames...</p>

          <section>
            <p>I could cut the images up into several components and animate them with css <a href="wind.html" target="_blank">something like this</a>...</p>

          <section>
            <p>If only I could make the keyboard image map <a href="hoverCoords.html" target="_blank">responsive</a> to the correct coordinates...</p>
